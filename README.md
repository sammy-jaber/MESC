High power ESC using VESC logic

MIGHTY VESC (MESC) - HIGH POWER INVERTERS RUNNING VESCÂ® SOFTWARE

MESC is my first generation controller. It was designed to be used in light to medium vehicles running at low voltages.
Pair it with a powerful motor and battery supplying enough juice and it is perfect for your DIY EV conversion project.

MESC - G1 specs:

144V max supply voltage 

600A max phase current

Phase current sensors (hall)

72x IPT059N15N3 150V MOSFET

This monstrosity is a 72 FET design. It uses 150V TOLL (HSOF-8) mosfets and is designed for input voltages up to 144V. 
It's primarily intended for light and medium duty electric vehicles. It features integrated high efficiency 12V 5A dcdc power supply and custom input connectors
to ensure easy throttle connection. I'm using hall current sensors - similar design as electric cars.
It was designed up to 600A phase current. 

Three board design: 
1: Aluminum substrate power stage at the bottom to provide the best thermal interface with the heatsink/ Busbars are soldered onto power stage pcb to carry high current.

2: DC link & Driver.

3: Control board conntect to the DC Link board

The board is also ready for high voltage modification. With suitable capacitors and mosfets it is possible to turn this board into higher voltage / lower current
controller.
